🚗 Vehicle Insurance Claim Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vehicle insurance claims data to identify patterns, understand customer behavior, and explore the factors that influence the likelihood of a claim. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

🎯 Objective

👉 The main objective is to determine whether a vehicle should be marked as Present ✅ or Absent ❌ in the context of claim analysis.
